## Copilot / AI agent instructions for this repository

Status: repository appears to be empty in the current workspace — no source files or project manifests (package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, README.md, Dockerfile, Makefile) were found. If this is incorrect, please commit or mount the project files and re-run the agent.

Goal for the agent
- Quickly discover the project's language, build, test, and run commands.
- Make small, well-scoped code changes only after confirming the target files and build/test commands.

Quick contract
- Input: repository files available at the workspace root.
- Output: small, tested edits (1-3 files) with accompanying tests or verification steps when possible.
- Error modes: missing build/test commands or missing source files — in that case ask the repo maintainer before changing behavior.

Action checklist (what to run first)
1. Inventory common files (stop after you find any of these):
   - `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock` (Node)
   - `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg` (Python)
   - `go.mod`, `Makefile`, `cmd/` (Go)
   - `README.md`, `.github/workflows/**` (CI hints)
2. If you find a manifest, extract build/test/run commands (e.g., `scripts` in `package.json`, `tool.poetry.scripts` or `tox.ini`/`pytest` for Python, `go test ./...`).
3. If the repo is empty or files are missing, stop and prompt the human with the minimal questions below.

Minimal questions to ask when files are missing or ambiguous
- What is the main language / runtime for this repo?
- How do I build and run the project locally? (example commands)
- How do I run tests? Provide a fast smoke test command if available.
- Which files are safe to modify for small changes (feature, bugfix, tests)?

Project-specific patterns to prefer (how to infer when present)
- Node: prefer editing code under `src/` or `lib/`; use `npm test`/`pnpm test` if `package.json` has `scripts`.
- Python: prefer `src/` package layout; run `pytest -q` when `pyproject.toml` or `tests/` exists.
- Go: prefer changes in `cmd/` or packages under `internal/` or `pkg/`; run `go test ./...`.
- CI: consult `.github/workflows` for the actual commands used in CI to mirror developer flows.

Examples to include in PRs or commits
- Short commit message describing intent and scope (one line). Example: `fix(api): return 400 on missing param`
- Include a one-line test or verification: `Ran: npm test --silent` or `Ran: pytest tests/test_foo.py -q` (adjust per project).

When to ask before changing code
- No build or test commands are discoverable.
- The change touches many files (>3) or modifies public APIs.

Notes for maintainers
- If you want richer, project-specific guidance for AI agents, add a `README.md` or update this file with:
  - canonical build/test/run commands
  - source layout (where to find services, web UI, CLI entrypoints)
  - any nonstandard patterns (generated code, custom codegen steps, private registries)

Edit history
- Generated by an automated assistant on an empty workspace scan. Update this file when the repository content is available.
